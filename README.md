# LAPS-Multi-Domain-GUI

![LAPS_GUI Example](Images/example.png)

Tool was created because the Microsoft provided LAPS GUI client does not support querying computers in more than one domain. Currently used for only 2 domains but can easily be updated for as many Domains/domain controllers as needed to fit your needs.
